#  🕶️☕ StarBrew Lens - An AR Powered Ordering Experience

## 🌍 The Challenge
Create the future Starbucks Digital Experience for Dubai

## 🧠 What This Hackathon Is About
Starbucks aims to elevate the digital customer experience in Dubai: a city known for innovation, speed, and cutting-edge technology.
With META platforms such as Instagram WhatsApp, and Facebook, students can use tools like AL, chatbots, AR filters, and digital engineering to imagine a new way for customers to connect with Starbucks.

## 🛠️ Our Project

Busy morning workers often waste time in long queues, while static menus slow down decision-making.  
**StarBrew Lens** uses **Augmented Reality (AR)** to make Starbucks ordering **faster, more fun, and highly personalized**.

### 🚀 Key Features

- 🎨 **Match Your Drink**  
  AI analyzes your outfit (colors, style, and mood) and recommends a Starbucks drink, displayed with floating AR visuals and aesthetic filters.

- 🥤 **Make Your Drink**  
  Customize your drink in real time — select type, temperature, milk, syrups, toppings, and cup style, with live 3D AR updates.

- ⚡ **Hurry Burry (Grab-and-Go Mode)**  
  Pre-select favorite drinks, set arrival time, and receive AR notifications like *“Your drink is waiting”* for fast pickup.

- 🌦️ **Weather Mood Drink**  
  Detects current weather (hot, cold, rainy, night) and recommends drinks accordingly — iced espresso on hot days, hot chocolate on cold days.

- 🎮 **AR Games & Rewards**  
  Play coffee-themed AR mini-games, earn points, and convert them into Starbucks Stars or exclusive offers.

- 📍 **AR Navigation**  
  Follow AR arrows and floating icons to quickly locate the nearest Starbucks store.

✨ **Outcome:** Reduced wait times, personalized experiences, higher engagement, and seamless ordering for fast-paced urban lifestyles.
